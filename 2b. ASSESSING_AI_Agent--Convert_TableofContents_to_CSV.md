# Assessing Agent Performance and Practicality 

While the AI agent (processing images and outputting structured data) works, it needs improvement.  

This process is more flexible correctable with the online version of Gemini.  

The processing is slower using an API compared to online Gemini. In rare cases, the API model has added symbols like an unclosed quote, which results in error when loading string as a JSON. Online, it can remember on its own (no need for batch memory) and you can directly download multiple .TXT files, eliminating the need for a JSON entirely.  

Additionally, in the online version of Gemini, the user can notice and point out changes in real time, as well as specify differences between tables of contents; while this is more manual, it's more flexible. Another AI agent would have to be created to do this function if using the code.

Overall, this agent works and is helpful, but in practice, I'd choose to use the online version of Gemini for its flexibility. Looking forward, I would consider creating another AI agent to allow feedback and a final pass, and run the code in Colab to increase speed.
